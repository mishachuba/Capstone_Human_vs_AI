### Project Title
Machine Learning Techniques for Distinguishing Between Human and AI-Generated Text

** by Mykhaylo Chuba **

#### Executive summary
TBD


#### Rationale
In the era of information proliferation, distinguishing between human and AI-generated content is vital to address issues of authenticity, misinformation, and trust. Understanding the characteristics of AI-generated text can help make AI tools more transparent and accountable. With the increasing use of AI in generating content, it becomes crucial to ensure compliance with copyright laws, academic requirements, and regulations. By identifying AI-generated texts accurately, we can prevent the misuse of AI and contribute to safer AI deployments

#### Research Question
Can machine learning models effectively differentiate between text generated by humans and text produced by artificial intelligence?

#### Methodology
For this natural language processing experiment, Iâ€™m using a variety of machine learning classification techniques, such as Logistic Regression, Decision trees, KNN and SVM. The analysis involves preprocessing the text, extracting features that could distinguish between human and AI texts, and selecting the best-performing model based on evaluation techniques such as accuracy score, precision, recall, F1-score, time-to-fit, etc.

#### Results
During the project, I evaluated four different natural language processing models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN and SVM. SVM had the highest accuracy score of 0.986 with the best parameters {'svc__C': 10, 'svc__kernel': 'rbf', 'vect__max_features': 5000}; however, it took the longest time to fit of 316 sec. Therefore, I recommend using the Logistic Regression model, which had a slightly lower accuracy score of 0.983 with best parameters {'lgr__C': 0.1, 'vect__max_features': 5000}, but took only 1 sec to fit. For 0.3% reduction in accuracy compared to SVM, it consumes 316X less componential power. This could be particularly beneficial if we want to scale the model and fit it on a larger data set. It also produces the highest recall score of 0.986. Since maximizing for the True Positives is arguably more important in classifying human vs. AI-generated text, as it reduces the amount of misclassified human as AI, Logistic Logistic is definitely better suited for this task.
